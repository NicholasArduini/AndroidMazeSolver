# AndroidMazeSolver
Android Application that solves a maze recursively where progress is shown visually, with computations taking place on a separate thread. User can select start and finish positions as well as walls for the path to avoid. If a path is possible it will be displayed in blue buttons. Computations continue on rotation as the UI continues to update. While the path computation is taking place it cannot be interrupted by touching buttons.
